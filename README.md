# My Compliance Project

This is a project that includes [Compliance as Code Loader](https://github.com/ComplianceNinjas/compliance-as-code-loader) and [Compliance as Code](https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content) as submodules.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository, including submodules, by running the following command:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ComplianceNinjas/compliance-as-code-docker
```

If you have already cloned the repository without the submodules, you can initialize and update the submodules with the following commands:

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

2. Now you have the project and its submodules initialized.
3. You can navigate to the loader and content directories to work on them individually.

You will need to have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.

1. Navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal.

2. Run the following command to start the Docker containers defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```bash
...
```
